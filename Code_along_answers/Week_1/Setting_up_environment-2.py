# Basic usage of print()
print("Hello, world")
print("welcome to Python programming.")

# Using print() with variables
name= "Lukman"
age = 25
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)

# Using f-strings with print()
name = "Bola"
score = 92
print(f"{name} scored {score} in the exam.")

# Using string concactenation
first_name = "Lukman"
last_name = "Ibrahim"
print(f"Full name: " + first_name + " " + last_name)

# Comma vs concatenation
print("Helllo", "world")            # With comma
print("Hello" + " " + "world!")     # With concatenation
